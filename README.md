# K-Nearest-Neighbours-KNN-and-The-Naive-Bayes-Classifier
# Purpose of the Repository

The aim of this project is to apply supervised learning algorithms; KNN and naive Bayes Classifiers.

The analysis will perform;

* Feature transformation and dimensionality reduction techniques so as to increase the quality of the feature space.
* Compare multiple reggression and choose the one that performs best.


# Success Metrics

* Sucessful Exploratory Data Analysis.
* Sucessful feature engineering.
* Sucessful check of multicollinearity.
* Sucessful generation of a K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN)  and Naive-Bayes Classifier models.
* Sucessful optimization of model parameters.
* Sucessful Computation of accuracy score on all models.
* Sucessful selection of the prefered model.



# The repository contains the following files/folders:
